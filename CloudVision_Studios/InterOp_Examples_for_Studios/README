Studios Fabric Interop Examples using the Enterprise Routing Studio

These examples are meant to be run on the Advanced Routing ATD. If your environment differs from the 
topology and hostnames on the ATD these example files need to be modified.
See the included Power Point for detailed instructions

Supporting Information
This section contains information to support you in completing the examples. It provides an explanation of the tools used and the necessary workflows you will complete.

The examples reference the information given here, so you can complete the examples without reading through the supporting information.

Introduction
This document contains several use case examples for understanding how to leverage Studios to meet current customer needs. Each example uses multiple studios to deploy complex networks, and the configuration for each deployment is provided. Once deployed, the example networks can be tested to demonstrate functionality.

Topics Covered
1.	Loading and deleting tags through the API
2.	Working with Studios github repository
3.	Importing custom Studios, cloning Studios
4.	Turning on Alpha features
5.	Import and export of inputs files
6.	Combining Roles on devices to inter-connect them
7.	Editing Studios UI schema
8.	eBGP and policy
9.	Protocol redistribution
10.	Building EVPNs over DCs and a routed Campus
11.	Configuring virtual switch stacks
12.	OSPFv3 and IPv6
13.	Editing Studios templates
14.	Getting the latest built-in Studios from the CloudVision repo

Tools Used
The examples and their configuration are provided through GitHub. You will be able to import each studios configuration and upload tags using a script, tagman.py, provided in the repository. This means that minimal time will be required to configure the studios.

You’ll use an Arista Advanced Routing ATD for these examples, which provides a CloudVision environment.

Base Topology
Each example uses devices from the below topology, which you should familiarise yourself with:
 

Each example has its own topology based on this, and which is provided in the instructions for the examples. 
Example Files and Script
The examples are contained in a GitHub repository and contain all of the configuration and the supporting script to successfully complete each example.

Repository
The repository is accessible here: 
https://github.com/arista-netdevops-community/CloudVisionPortal-Examples

The examples are contained in the following path:
CloudVisionPortal-Examples/CloudVision_Studios/InterOp_Examples_for_Studios/

The Studio versions to be used are in the CloudVisionPortal-Examples/CloudVision_Studios/InterOp_Examples_for_Studios/
/Studios_to_Use directory.

Tags Files to import are in the CloudVisionPortal-Examples/CloudVision_Studios/InterOp_Examples_for_Studios/
/Tags_Files directory.

Each Ex. X Example directory contains the inputs for  each studio used in that example.
 

 
Tagman Script
The tagman.py script, which is used to manage the tags required for each example. You’ll run this script to add or delete the tags for the examples; each example’s folder contains a .txt file, which is composed of that example’s tags.

The tagman.py script is found in CloudVisionPortal-Examples/CloudVision_Studios/InterOp_Examples_for_Studios/
/Tags_Files directory.
